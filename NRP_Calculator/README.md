Abstract:

Engineered genetic systems are prone to failure when their genetic parts contain repetitive sequences. Designing many non-repetitive genetic parts with desired functionalities remains a significant challenge with high computational complexity. To overcome this challenge, we developed the Non-Repetitive Parts Calculator to rapidly generate thousands of highly non-repetitive genetic parts from specified design constraints, including promoters, ribosome binding sites, and terminators. As demonstrations, we designed and experimentally characterized 4350 non-repetitive bacterial σ70 promoters with transcription rates that varied across a 820,000-fold range, and 1722 highly non-repetitive yeast promoters with transcription rates that varied across a 25,000-fold range. We applied machine learning to explain how specific interactions controlled the promoters’ transcription rates. We also show that using non-repetitive genetic parts substantially reduces homologous recombination, resulting in greater genetic stability.
